Your plan will remain active until your current billing cycle ends \u2014 December\u202f8,\u202f2023 \u2014 and then it will move to the free plan at no additional cost. Here\u2019s what this means: while your subscription is still active, you\u2019ll continue enjoying all Essential features \u2014 unlimited forms, logic jumps, and access to response analytics \u2014 until midnight on your billing anniversary. After that, your account will shift to free, where you can still create forms and collect responses (with some feature limits). Any forms you\u2019ve published will remain live, and your previous data will still be available for download. If you've changed your mind or want to reconsider upgrading, we\u2019re here and happy to help. Just head over to Account \u2192 Plan & Billing, and you can easily pick a plan that suits your needs \u2014 or re-upgrade to Essential when you're ready. And of course, if you need support with anything, our Help Center is always open. Thank you, Emilia, for being part of the Typeform community. We appreciate the time and effort you\u2019ve invested in building with us. We hope to see you again soon \u2014 and remember, even on the free plan, you can continue creating forms and learning with us whenever you\u2019re ready. Warmly, \u2014\u202fThe Typeform Team"
