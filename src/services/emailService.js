/**
 * Email Service Module
 * 
 * This module provides a client interface to an external email API service.
 * It encapsulates all communication with the email system and provides high-level
 * abstractions for retrieving and processing email data.
 * 
 * The service acts as a bridge between the application and external email providers,
 * handling authentication, error management, pagination, and data normalization.
 * 
 * Key responsibilities:
 * - Authenticating requests to the email API using user tokens
 * - Fetching email content from the external API
 * - Normalizing email data format for internal use
 * - Managing rate limits and batch processing
 * - Handling API-specific error conditions

/**
 * Email API Client Configuration
 * 
 * Create a configured Axios instance for making HTTP requests to the email API.
 * This pre-configured client ensures consistent settings across all API calls:
 * 
 * - baseURL: The root URL for all email API endpoints
 * - timeout: Maximum time to wait for API responses before timing out
 * - headers: Default HTTP headers to include with every request
 * 
 * Using a dedicated client instance also enables:
 * - Request/response interceptors if needed
 * - Default error handling
 * - Consistent authentication handling
 * 
 * Example API request using this client:
 * emailApiClient.get('/emails/123') would make a GET request to:
 * https://email-api.example.com/emails/123 (assuming that's the baseURL)

/**
 * Get a list of email IDs for a user
 * 
 * Retrieves a paginated list of email IDs from the external email service.
 * This function is designed for efficiency by:
 * - Requesting only ID fields to minimize payload size
 * - Supporting pagination to handle large email collections
 * - Using consistent error handling patterns
 * 
 * Typical usage patterns:
 * 1. Initial data discovery: "What emails does this user have?"
 * 2. Batch processing setup: "Get me all email IDs to process"
 * 3. Pagination for user interfaces: "Show me page 2 of emails"
 * 
 * Example API response structure:
 * {
 *   "items": [
 *     { "id": "email_123", ... },
 *     { "id": "email_124", ... }
 *   ],
 *   "page": 1,
 *   "totalPages": 5,
 *   "totalItems": 42
 * }
 * 
 * @param {string} userToken - Authentication token identifying the user
 * @param {object} options - Pagination and filtering options
 * @param {number} [options.page=1] - Page number to retrieve (1-indexed)
 * @param {number} [options.limit=config.emailService.batchSize] - Number of emails per page
 * @returns {Promise<string[]>} - Array of email IDs for the given user and page
